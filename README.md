Your task is to create a Gradebook class, a Student class, and a Main class


The Gradebook should contain some Students and assignments

The Student class should contain corresponding assignment names and grades


You can create other private methods, but the only public methods should be as listed below

Public Methods for Gradebook:

	Gradebook()
	void createStudent(String name)
	void addAssignment(String assignment)
	void gradeAssignment(String assignment, String studentName, double grade)
	double getAverageGrade(String assignment)
	double getMinimumGrade(String assignment)
	double getMaximumGrade(String assignment)
	double getAverageOverall()
	double getMaxOverall()
	double getMinOverall()
	double getStudentsGrade()
	String toString() //Returns the names of the students and the names of the assignments as a String
	Student getStudent(String studentName)

Public Methods for Student:

	Student(String name)
	void addAssignment(String assignName) //start as ungraded
	void gradeAssignment(String assignment, double grade)
	double getAssignmentGrade(String assignment)
	double getOverallGrade() //should ignore ungraded assignments
	String toString() -Return the Student name and the students average
